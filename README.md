# Learning Recommendation System

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **database-driven Learning Recommendation System** designed to provide **personalized course recommendations** to users. The system leverages user preferences, past course completions, and user-provided course outlines to generate tailored learning suggestions. The goal is to enhance the online learning experience by recommending the most relevant courses based on individual learning patterns. This is a course project under Prof. Amarnath Mitra for the subject Big Data Management and Analytics

## 🏗️ Database Schema
The system is built using a **relational database model** with well-normalized tables to ensure efficiency and integrity. The key components include:

- **`SD_USERS`** → Maintains user details and preferences.
- **`SD_CATEGORIES`** → Defines course categories for better classification.
- **`SD_COURSES`** → Stores course details and ratings.
- **`SD_REVIEWS`** → Captures user feedback on courses.
- **`SD_COMPLETION_RECORDS`** → Tracks course progress and completion percentages.
- **`SD_COURSE_OUTLINES`** → Allows users to submit course outlines for personalized recommendations.
- **`SD_RECOMMENDATIONS`** → Stores system-generated course recommendations based on user history.
- **`SD_OUTLINE_RECOMMENDATIONS`** → Suggests courses based on course outlines submitted by users.

## 🔍 Key Functionalities
- **Personalized Learning Pathways** – Users receive tailored course suggestions based on their preferences and past interactions.
- **Course Reviews & Ratings** – Collects user feedback to refine recommendations.
- **Progress Tracking** – Monitors learning engagement and completion trends.
- **Outline-Based Recommendations** – Generates course suggestions based on user-submitted outlines.
- **Data Consistency & Integrity** – Implements foreign key constraints, indexing, and validation checks to maintain data quality.

## 🏛️ Database Implementation
### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**
- MySQL (or a compatible database system)
- A SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver)
- Git (for version control, if needed)

### **2️⃣ Database Setup & Execution**
- **Schema Creation**: Execute `Database_LRS.sql` to set up the database.
- **Data Population**: Insert sample data using `Dummy_Data.sql` (if applicable).
- **Validation & Testing**: Run `Stress_Testing.sql` to verify constraints, normalization, and data integrity.

## 🔎 Data Integrity & Stress Testing
The system undergoes rigorous stress testing to ensure:
- **Primary Key Enforcement** – No duplicate primary keys exist.
- **Foreign Key Validations** – Ensures referential integrity across tables.
- **Normalization Compliance** – Data follows **1NF, 2NF, and 3NF**.
- **Performance Optimization** – Uses indexing to enhance query efficiency.
- **Data Consistency Checks** – Identifies missing or inconsistent records.

For detailed validation, please take a look at the **Stress_Testing.sql** file.
